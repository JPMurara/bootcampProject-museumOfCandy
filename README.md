# Museum of Candy Project <img align="center" src="https://github.com/JPMurara/images/blob/main/hand2.png" width="50" title="logo">

This is my second project which I used some of the HTML, CSS and Bootstrap skills learnt at the bootcamp.
Please check the project at https://jpmurara.github.io/bootcampProject-museumOfCandy/

The Museum of Candy is a responsive project that I worked on just after finishing the Bootstrap unit of my bootcamp. This is a basic project to demonstrate my skills with Bootstrap and CSS, in addition to HTML.
The key features of this projects are:
A nav bar that toggles when the screen size is reduced
Hover effect on the nav bar links as well as background color change when scroll down the page
The content displayed on the screen changes from row to column when the screen is resized to ensure the page is responsive
Hours spent in this project: 12h
